# AnimeApp (Final Name TBD)

  Deployment Ideas: 
  - when creating locally, make a new branch when making new features.
  - we can then submit PR requests for each other to review the changes and push it to main.
  - when we are satisfied with the new changes, delete that branch and start a new one
